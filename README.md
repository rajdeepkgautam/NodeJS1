# What is Node.JS & Why it is used ?
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project, basically it is used for backend application.

It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.js is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. Previously, Dahl had criticized the limited possibilities offered by existing popular web servers and common coding methods.

It connect frontend through backend by using APIs, API communicate with server and database to provide data to the webpage.
